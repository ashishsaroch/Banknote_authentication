# Banknote_authentication
Analysis of Banknote Authentication System Using Different Machine Learning Techniques
### DESCRIPTION 
  - A Machine learning application to predict whether or not a banknote is authentic.


## DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è
 It is an End-to-End project to present the idea that how we can use ML into precision banknote authentication if developped at large scale with enough data. So don't use it for making banknotes authentication decisions. 

## MOTIVATION üí™  
- To contribute on sharing knowledge to the data science community.
