# Banknote_authentication
Analysis of Banknote Authentication System Using Different Machine Learning Techniques
### DESCRIPTION  <code><img height="30" src="https://github.com/ourylydibin/Banknote-Authentication/blob/main/static/css/bn.jpg"></code>
  - A Machine learning application to predict whether or not a banknote is authentic.
  - The application was containerized with Docker container and deployed with Kubernetes Engine in Google Cloud Platform.

## DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è
This project is a POC(Proof of concept). It is an End-to-End project to present the idea that how we can use ML into precision banknote authentication if developped at large scale with enough data. So don't use it for making banknotes authentication decisions. 

## MOTIVATION üí™  
- To contribute on sharing knowledge to the data science community.
